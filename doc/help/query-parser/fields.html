<div class="section">
<p>Puggle supports fielded data. When performing a search you can either specify a field, or use the default field. The field names and default field is implementation specific.</p>
<p>You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon ":" and then the term you are looking for. </p>
<p>As an example, let's assume a Lucene index contains two fields, title and text and text is the default field.
        If you want to find the document entitled "The Right Way" which contains the text "don't go this way", you can enter: </p>
<pre class="code">title:"The Right Way" AND text:go</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="code">title:"Do it right" AND right</pre>
<p>Since text is the default field, the field indicator is not required.</p>

<p>Note: The field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so the query</p>
<pre class="code">title:Do it right</pre>
<p>Will only find "Do" in the title field. It will find "it" and "right" in the default field (in this case the text field). </p>
