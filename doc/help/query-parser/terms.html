<h2 class="boxed">Terms</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases.</p>
<p>A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".</p>
<p>A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".</p>
<p>Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query (see below).</p>
<p>Note: The analyzer used to create the index will be used on the terms and phrases in the query string.
        So it is important to choose an analyzer that will not interfere with the terms used in the query string.</p>
