1. INTRODUCTION
============================
Puggle is a desktop search engine written exclusively in Java. It provides
full text search over files, folders, music, photos, web pages and more
that are stored locally on your computer.

With Puggle it is able to create many different indices, each with different
configuration. For example, you may have a different index for your music
collection as well as your documents. Each of them can be used on demand, by
simply loading it.

Furthermore, Puggle supports indexing of portable devices, like USB flash
drives or external hard disks. The index will be stored in the device, using
relative paths, allowing to search over the data very quickly on any computer.

Puggle is built in top of the famous Apache Lucene library and can run in
various operating systems, including MS Windows and Linux.


2. HOW TO RUN
============================
Puggle needs Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 6 or later to run. You
can download it from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp, if it
is not already installed on your system.

Puggle is composed of two parts: the Indexer and the Searcher. The Indexer
is responsible for building and updating the index. The Searcher uses the
index to evaluate the queries supplied by the user and present the results.

Windows
-------
You can either install Puggle, using the setup installer, or use the
executable files.
To run Puggle, execute the 'puggle.exe' file (or 'puggle.bat' script)
that is located in bin/ directory.

Linux
-------
To run Puggle, execute the 'puggle.sh' script that is located in bin/
directory.


3. HOW TO BUILD FROM SOURCES
============================
You have to install Java SDK 6 or later in order to compile Puggle. You can
download it from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp, if it is
not already installed on your system.
The best way to compile the source code is to use Netbeans.  Using Netbeans,
simply import the 'Puggle' directory as a new project.
